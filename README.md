# Gate

---
### This is alpha grade software
---

Opinionated lib based on [httprouter](https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter) to build REST APIs.

## Usage
---

A cardinal goal I have with this library is to be able to spit put [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org) definitions automagically. To do that I need to know a few things explicitly:
1. The endpoint
2. The request payload and its `content-type` if any
3. the query payload if any
4. the response payload and its `content-type` if any
5. A title and version for the API

While `Gate` does not generate any documentation yet - the groundwork for it has been laid in the way you use it.

Here's how a POST request looks in Gate

```go
package main

import (
	"encoding/json"
	"log"

	"github.com/enalk-com/gate"
	"github.com/getkin/kin-openapi/openapi3"
)

/* gate provides a Payload interface that must be used
in API definitions and their handlers to access said data.
Since generics are still a little bit away the definitions
need to use a intialized instance of said payload.
Here's how all that looks*/

// Define a payload type
type StringJSON string

func (sj StringJSON) Marshal() ([]byte, error) {
	return json.Marshal(sj)
}
func (sj *StringJSON) Unmarshal(src []byte) error {
	var v string
	if err := json.Unmarshal(src, &v); err != nil {
		return err
	}
	*sj = StringJSON(v)
	return nil
}
func (StringJSON) ContentType() gate.ContentType {
	return gate.ContentTypeJSON
}
// The above three functions Marshal, Unmarshal and
// ContentType implement the gate.Payload interface

// This is just a helper function to get a
// StringJSON pointer - or a gate.Payload
func NewStringJSON(s string) *StringJSON {
	t := StringJSON(s)
	return &t
}

// below is a request handler that accepts a
// JSON string and responds back with a JSON
// string by prepending the pattern "YOLO"
func yoloHandler(rc *gate.RequestCtx, rd *gate.RequestData) (gate.Payload, error) {
	sj, ok := rd.Body.(*StringJSON)
	if !ok {
		// returning an error automatically responds back with
		// the corresponding code of the error
		// Here for example, the client with receive the error code
		// 400 and a text message "Bad Request"
		return nil, gate.ErrBadRequest
	}
	sj = NewStringJSON("YOLO" + string(*sj))
	return sj, nil
}

func main() {
	// Now lets define the api server
	app, err := gate.New(gate.AppOptions{
		Info: openapi3.Info{
			Title:   "sampleAPI",
			Version: "0.0.1",
		},
		Addr: ":8080",
	})
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	sj := NewStringJSON("")
	// The usage of `sj` below is only so that gate knows what
	// type to marshal and unmarshal the payloads into
	// the initialized value sj above serves no other purpose
	// at the moment. Maybe this'll be better with generics.
	// But this is where we're at now.
	app.Post(gate.EndpointConfig{
		Path:    "/yolofy",
		Handler: yoloHandler,
		Payload: gate.EndpointPayload{
			RequestPayload:  sj,
			ResponsePayload: sj,
		},
	})
	log.Println("Listening at :8080")
	if err := app.Listen(); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}

```

Now simply use CURL to verify:
`curl -d '""' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X POST http://localhost:8080/yolofy`

You should see `"YOLO"` as output.
The quotes are needed and exist in the response since it's a JSON string.

### This documentation like the whole project is also a WIP. It should be updated as soon as I have more time. Thank you for your patience üôè
